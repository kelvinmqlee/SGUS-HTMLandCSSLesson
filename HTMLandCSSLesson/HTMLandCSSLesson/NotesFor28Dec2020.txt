Geo-Mapping:
A Map API (also known as Mapping API) provides location intelligence for software developers creating location-based products and services. It is the base building block for location-aware applications, feature-rich maps and the retrieval of geographic-related data. It allows you to create location-aware infographics, mind maps and visualization aids.

A typical Map API includes features for geocoding, reverse geocoding, geolocation, directions and navigation, touch-screen interaction, different types of maps (e.g. terrain or satellite) and customizable control objects.
